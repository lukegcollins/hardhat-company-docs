### App Attack
#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

Deakin's OnTrack online application will undergo secure code review and web application penetration testing from AppAttack. The objective is to deliver a comprehensive security report to Deakin that includes identification of vulnerabilities and recommendations for application and code hardening.

The AppAttack project for this trimester will begin from scratch. Except for the retesting of prior findings, earlier iterations and deliverables won't be carried over into this trimester.

Additionally, the goal of AppAttack is to provide internal deliverables to support subsequent rounds of AppAttack as well as deliverables of value to our customer Deakin. Internal deliverables aim to develop methodology, frameworks, report templates, a centralised knowledge base, and exploitation tools to speed up client deliverables and increase the range of services and products offered by AppAttack.

#### Aims for Trimester

- Build a testing environment 
- Improving our testing environments
  - Each subteam will dive deep in one particilar part of OnTrack (like authentication, APIs) 
  - Provides instructions on replicating updated environment
  - Next trimester can doing the work continuous and not restart.
- Perform penetration testing on OnTracks in an attempt to find working exploits for vulnerability
  - Both successful and unsuccessful exploits should be recorded and discussed, including the
process of trial and error that was used to reach a working exploit
- Provide analysis for OnTrack codebase's security
  - Provide recommendation for both vulnerable and potential dangerous
- Develop procedures, templates, and techniques.
- Create an experience that is comparable to the industry for students to emphasise on resumes when applying for high-caliber professions.
- Add value for stakeholders, clients, and students.
- Offer Deakin University deliverables that are worthwhile.

#### Deliverables

- Deliver a Web Application Penetration Testing Report and Secure Code Review to Deakin University meet the industry standard.
- Cover all parts of OnTrack's codebase

### NASA Exploits Project
#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

NASA Protocol Exploits consists of a team that aims to evaluate security implementation in space communications. The motivation for this project is the sensitive nature of data that is communicated over satellites, which typically have ‘security’ low on the priority list. Our overall goal is to find different vulnerabilities in the protocols and systems used for space communications and to ultimately document successful exploitations, the methodologies behind them, and potential remedies.

#### Aims for Trimester


- Improve current documentation & testing enviroments:
   - Improve the current state of training documentation.
   - Improve the current start of the testing enviroment.
   - Migrate all the the training and required upskills documents to Github.  
 - Begin Static Code analysis:
   - Details on the deliverables.
   - More details on the deliverables.
 - Continue Dynamic Code analysis:
   - Details on the deliverables.
   - More details on the deliverables.
