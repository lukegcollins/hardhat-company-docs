## Company Structure and Projects Overview
This trimester (T3/2022), the company is working on five different projects, each supporting the goals of the company in a different way.  

### Breaking CAPTCHA
#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

The goal of the Breaking CAPTCHA project is to develop machine learning, AI, and computer vision models to autonomously solve CAPTCHA problems. The final product of the project will be to provide end users with an interface to solve these CAPTCHA problems. This user interface will be the focus of future iterations.The Hardhat Director wants a product that improves upon current open-source solutions for this problem. As a result, the models to be produced will need to be either more accurate, reliable, or solve a novel issue facing current CAPTCHA solving models. This will be done through several steps, including research and development, creating of models, and deployment of models as well as engineering of deployment and model pipelines. This will be supported by cloud infrastructure developed to solve storage, processing, DevOps and handover issues allowing for the production of ‘infrastructure as code’ artefacts.  

#### Aims for Trimester

The project aims for this trimester are to leverage the learnings of previous work as well as the current capability of the team. Our trimester deliverables will be: •

- Infrastructure as code product to enable efficient handover of cloud infrastructure. 
- Improving the performance of the Machine learning model that breaks Audio CAPTCHAs.
- Developing novel methods for solving Audio CAPTCHAS
- Progressing the development of a non-segmentation model that will break text CAPTCHAs.
- An Improved pipeline which connects R&D and UI deliverables through Machine Learning pipelines, CI/CD pipelines and improved infrastructure.
- Improving the showcase website in both usability and runtime.

#### Deliverables

Trimester Deliverables

- Text and Audio CAPTCHA breaking black box models which are versioned and operationalised
- Improved performance of CAPTCHA breaking models
- Improved runtime of Cloud based solutions
- Connectivity between R&D and Products using Cloud resources as well as CI/CD and ML pipelines
- Improved Documentation of progress to date
- Improved analysis of state of the art of the Breaking CAPTCHA
- Possibly research and proof of concept solutions for cognitive reasoning based CAPTCHAS

Long Term Deliverables

- An end user product that will allow a user to solve CAPTCHA in real-time with minimal human input 
  - App or website
  - Chrome Extension

### App Attack
#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

Deakin's OnTrack online application will undergo secure code review and web application penetration testing from AppAttack. The objective is to deliver a comprehensive security report to Deakin that includes identification of vulnerabilities and recommendations for application and code hardening.

The AppAttack project for this trimester will begin from scratch. Except for the retesting of prior findings, earlier iterations and deliverables won't be carried over into this trimester.

Additionally, the goal of AppAttack is to provide internal deliverables to support subsequent rounds of AppAttack as well as deliverables of value to our customer Deakin. Internal deliverables aim to develop methodology, frameworks, report templates, a centralised knowledge base, and exploitation tools to speed up client deliverables and increase the range of services and products offered by AppAttack.

#### Aims for Trimester

- Build a testing environment 
- Improving our testing environments
  - Each subteam will dive deep in one particilar part of OnTrack (like authentication, APIs) 
  - Provides instructions on replicating updated environment
  - Next trimester can doing the work continuous and not restart.
- Perform penetration testing on OnTracks in an attempt to find working exploits for vulnerability
  - Both successful and unsuccessful exploits should be recorded and discussed, including the
process of trial and error that was used to reach a working exploit
- Provide analysis for OnTrack codebase's security
  - Provide recommendation for both vulnerable and potential dangerous
- Develop procedures, templates, and techniques.
- Create an experience that is comparable to the industry for students to emphasise on resumes when applying for high-caliber professions.
- Add value for stakeholders, clients, and students.
- Offer Deakin University deliverables that are worthwhile.

#### Deliverables

- Deliver a Web Application Penetration Testing Report and Secure Code Review to Deakin University meet the industry standard.
- Cover all parts of OnTrack's codebase

### NASA Exploits Project
#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

NASA Protocol Exploits consists of a team that aims to evaluate security implementation in space communications. The motivation for this project is the sensitive nature of data that is communicated over satellites, which typically have ‘security’ low on the priority list. Our overall goal is to find different vulnerabilities in the protocols and systems used for space communications and to ultimately document successful exploitations, the methodologies behind them, and potential remedies.

#### Aims for Trimester


- Improve current documentation & testing enviroments:
   - Improve the current state of training documentation.
   - Improve the current start of the testing enviroment.
   - Migrate all the the training and required upskills documents to Github.  
 - Begin Static Code analysis:
   - Details on the deliverables.
   - More details on the deliverables.
 - Continue Dynamic Code analysis:
   - Details on the deliverables.
   - More details on the deliverables.
